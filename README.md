<img src="./screenshot.png" />

This is a proyect for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding.

## Description

This is my fisrt complete three tier web app, fullstack developed with the MERN stack. The frontend was developed with React js as framework. In the backend could find the API server developed with NodeJS and Express, and the database in MongoDB.

This project tries to imitate the basic operations of a bank, such as deposit, withdrawal and balance. It was named BadBank because at first it was just a frontend project, so it didn't have any kind of security system. Now it have authentication for both the backend and frontend using the Firebase authentication tool.
